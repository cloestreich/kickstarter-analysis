Kickstarting Project with Excel

## Overview and Purpose
The overview of the project is to use the data that has been compiled to help Louise with her project campaign. The purpose is to analyze how much money an individual project is aiming for as well the money pledged to said project and if that project will be successful or not.

## Analysis and Challenges
While analyzing the data, it looks like most of the projects that met their donation goal were successful.  Other projects that did not meet their goal either failed or were canceled. Projects also had to be in the spotlight to gain the campaign goal.
 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
I noticed that many of the successful projects happened in the first half of the year. There weren’t many canceled projects, but I’m guessing that was due to there not being a whole lot of motivation behind the endeavor as well a lack of pledgers.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Many of the projects that didn’t need a huge pledge were successful.  There were some that failed, but that was a small percentage.  Most of the projects that failed had a high goal to meet.  A small number of those projects were successful, but that was likely due to motivation behind the pledging campaign.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One of the challenges encountered with this dataset is that it’s tough to tell how much money backers/pledgers had at the time of the project needing to get on its feet.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Two conclusions that can be drawn from Outcomes based on Launch Date are that most successful projects happened in the 1st and 2nd quarter of the year.  Also there weren’t many projects that were attempted to get up and running in the 4th quarter of the year.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
A conclusion that can made about Outcomes based on Goals is that the higher the goal of money needed to be raised, the higher the probability of that project failing.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
As stated earlier: one of the limitations of the dataset is that it really doesn’t account for the state of the economy at the time.  This dataset spans a period of nine years.  It’s tough to say how much money backers/pledgers had at the time.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A possible graph that could be created would be a line graph based on donations per individual year.
